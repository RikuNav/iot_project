## <span style="color: rgb(26, 99, 169);">**Neccessity**</span>
The students and collaborators from Tecnológico de Monterrey do not have a clear, direct nor an immediate way of knowing which classrooms are occupied and which aren't in a camps building. This affects the students that want to find an empty classroom to do their activities with no interruptions. This also affects the appropiate consumption of electrical energy, since there are cases where a classroom is not occupied yet the lights are still one. Finally, it also affects the optimization of the patrol routes for the security staff, since they have no way of telling if a classroom is emty when it should be.

## <span style="color: rgb(26, 99, 169);">**Solution**</span>
A web application that allows the Tec community to easily know if a campus classroom is empty or not based on sound and movement sensors, whose results are stored in a data base.
